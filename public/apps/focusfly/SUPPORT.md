## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I start a focus session?
1. Tap "Book Flight" on the main screen
2. Choose your focus scenario (work, code, read, exercise, meditate, design)
3. Select your departure and destination airports
4. Select your preferred ambient sounds and map style
5. Tap "Start Flight" to begin your focus session

### How does the flight tracking work?
FocusFly uses a 3D globe to visualize your focus session as a flight. As you maintain focus, your flight progresses from your departure to destination in real-time. The longer you stay focused, the further your flight travels.

Yes! You can customize:
- **Ambient Sounds**: Choose from cabin noise, announcements, or silence
- **Map Style**: Select between standard, satellite, or hybrid map views
- **Focus Scenarios**: Pick the scenario that matches your activity

### How do I view my flight history?
Your completed flights are automatically saved and can be viewed in your flight history. This allows you to track your focus sessions over time.

### Is my data stored locally?
Yes, all your flight data, preferences, and session history are stored exclusively on your device. No data is collected, transmitted, or stored on external servers. Your privacy is our priority.
